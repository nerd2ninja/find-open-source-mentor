# Find Open-Source Mentor

### About us
Find Open-Source Mentor is a platform for beginners and experienced developers who own open-source projects or have ideas about such projects and need contributors and collaborators.
#### What the problem?
Beginner programmers have fear about contributing to open-source projects and too-little experience to do their first contributions, so they need someone who has experience and can give tasks, advices and reviews for them.

Experienced developers have open-source projects or project ideas but don't have enough time to work on them, they need someone who can do some tasks and contribute to their projects.

Find Open-Source Mentor is a platform to connect junior and opensorce mentors.

So, here the story begins...

### Domain models
**MVP Goal:**
- Mentor
- Mentee
- Project
- Task

**Near future:**
- Event (Someone - join/publish/contribute to project)
- Level (Mentor can specify task difficulty and it will be shown to begginners or for someone with some experience)
- And many other ideas which we welcome to discuss!
